LaFiancee web Crawler in Golang

This is a Golang project solely based on <https://github.com/douglasferlini/lafiancee-website-crawler>, as I didn't know how to work on search elements within a page to make the crawler work.

## TODO

* The data struct looks bad
* Create the response JSON
* Work on the Options interface, as mentioned in <https://github.com/bancodobrasil/stop-analyzing-api/issues/5#issuecomment-668276422>
